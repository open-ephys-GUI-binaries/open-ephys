# Open Ephys GUI - Neuropixels Version

Compiled binaries for the [Open Ephys GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI)

This repository contains a special version of the Open Ephys GUI for use with Neuropixels probes. The host application is up-to-date with the [neuropixels](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI/tree/neuropixels) branch of the Open Ephys GUI. Eventually, the Neuropixels plugins will become part of the main Open Ephys distribution.


## Installation

Copy the "open-ephys" directory anywhere on your machine and double-click "open-ephys.exe"

If the software can't open because of missing DLLs, you'll need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2015+](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

The application will open a console by default, which will allow you to see the status of various under-the-hood operations. We are planning to gradually fold some of this information into progress bar windows, so it's more obvious what is happening when.


## Compatible hardware:

- Neuropixels 1.0 probes, with PXI interface (use `Neuropix-PXI` plugin); requires basestation firmware version 1.1.123 and BSC firmware version 1.0.151
- Neuropixels 3a probes, with Ethernet interface (use `Neuropix-3a` plugin); requires firmware version 5.1 or 5.2

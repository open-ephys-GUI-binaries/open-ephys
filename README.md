# Open Ephys GUI Binaries (deprecated)

This repository formerly hosted compiled binaries for the Open Ephys GUI (https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI)

The latest binaries are now available via [this page](https://open-ephys.org/gui#download).

Neuropixels plugins are included by default in the Windows release.

Installation
============

1. Open the Windows Device Manager.

You can find the Device Manager in Windows 10 by right-clicking on the Start Menu Icon, then selecting 'Device Manager' in the popup menu. In Windows 7 you can left-click to open the usual Start Menu, then right-click on 'Computer' to get a popup menu and choose 'Manage'.

2. If Enclustra drivers are already installed, you must uninstall them as follows.

2a. Right-click on an enclustra entry, which will be named 'Enclustra PCI Express Adapter'.
2b. Select 'Uninstall device'.
2c. In the Uninstall dialog, if there is an option to delete driver software, check that box.
2d. Repeat the steps for each Enclustra entry (one per Imec BS card).
2e. The devices should now show up in the device manager as 'PCI Memory Controller'. If you do not see that, try updating the view by selecting 'Action/Scan for hardware changes'.

3. Install, which can only be done for 'PCI Memory Controller' entries, as follows:

3a. Right-click on the device entry and select 'Update driver.
3b. Browse to your previously extracted folder of Enclustra driver files and select that folder.


Done.
